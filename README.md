#Fine-Tuning and Inference Using GPT-2 and GPT-4 Models


**Model 1: GPT-2**
I initially started with fine-tuning GPT-2, attempting to get specific outputs that align with my project requirements. However, the results have been inconsistent or not as accurate as needed.

**Model 2: GPT-4**
After running into limitations with GPT-2, I transitioned to using GPT-4. The approach has involved providing correct prompts to obtain better responses and results. The switch to GPT-4 has significantly improved the quality of the outputs.

**Project Goals**
Fine-tune GPT-2 for specific tasks.
Evaluate GPT-2's performance against GPT-4.
Enhance the output quality using advanced techniques with GPT-4 and specific prompts.


**Technology Stack**
Python: For running the models and fine-tuning.
Hugging Face Transformers: Utilized for working with pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
GPT-2: For initial fine-tuning attempts.
GPT-4 (gpt-4o): For more advanced inference and improved accuracy.
